# Ginie-Micro ðŸš€

A secure CLI tool for generating microservice monorepo structures with REST or gRPC communication protocols.

## Features

- âœ… Generate microservice monorepos with REST or gRPC architecture
- âœ… Automatic setup of Husky git hooks
- âœ… Commitizen for standardized commit messages
- âœ… Security-hardened generation process
- âœ… Workspace configuration for monorepo management
- âœ… Docker-ready microservices

## Installation

### Global Installation
```bash
npm install -g ginie-micro
```

### Using npx (Recommended)
```bash
npx ginie-micro
```

## Usage

### Create a new monorepo
```bash
ginie-micro
```

### Add a microservice to existing monorepo
```bash
cd your-monorepo
npm run ginie
```

### Run security checks
```bash
ginie-micro --security-check
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a new project:
```bash
npx ginie-micro
```

### 2. Follow the prompts:

- ðŸ‘‰ Enter your project name
- ðŸ‘‰ Choose REST or gRPC protocol
- ðŸ‘‰ Select whether to include API Gateway
- ðŸ‘‰ Choose Nginx load balancer option
- ðŸ‘‰ Select whether to install Husky and Commitizen
- ðŸ‘‰ Enter your microservice names and choose their databases


### 3. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd your-project-name
npm install
```

### 4. Start the development environment:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
npm run dev
```
## Project Structure

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ nginx.conf (if selected)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ microservices/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api-gateway/ (if selected)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth-microservice/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user-microservice/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ payment-grpc-microservice/
â””â”€â”€ .husky/
```

## Network 

- âœ… Gateway Network: External-facing network for API Gateway and Nginx
- âœ… Internal Network: Isolated network for microservices and their databases
- âœ… Service Isolation: Each microservice has its own database and optional Redis instance

## Available Scripts

ðŸ‘‰ To add new microservices to monorepo
```bash
npm run ginie
```

ðŸ‘‰ To create standardized commit messages
```bash
npm run commit
```

ðŸ‘‰ To run all microservices in development mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

ðŸ‘‰ To run tests across all microservices
```bash
npm test
```

ðŸ‘‰ To run security audit
```bash
npm run audit
```

ðŸ‘‰ To run additional security checks
```bash
npm run security-check
```

ðŸ‘‰ To start all Docker services
```bash
npm run compose:up
```

ðŸ‘‰ To stop all Docker services
```bash
npm run compose:down
```

## FAQ

### Q: Can I add microservices with different databases?
#### A: Yes, during microservice generation, you can select different database types for each microservice.

### Q: How does the API Gateway work with microservices?
#### A: The API Gateway acts as a single entry point that routes requests to the appropriate microservice based on configuration.

### Q: Can I add the API Gateway later if I didn't select it initially?
#### A: Yes, you can run npm run ginie and it will guide you through adding an API Gateway.

### Q: How do I scale individual microservices?
#### A: You can modify the docker-compose.yml file to add replica counts for each service.

### Q: Is Windows supported?
#### A: Yes, ginie-micro works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Q: Can I customize the generated structure?
#### A: The generated structure follows industry best practices, but you can modify it after generation.
